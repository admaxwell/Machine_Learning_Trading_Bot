# Machine Learning Trading Bot
# Credit Risk Classification

This project produces a Jupyter Notebook that uses machine learning to assess credit risk. Using the imbalanced-learn library a logistic regression model will be built to compare healthy loans vs non healthy loans to determine credit risk. The models built in this project will use histroical data that is provided by a lending service company that focuses on peer to peer lending.
